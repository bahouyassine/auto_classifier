# React Front-End

This folder contains a minimal React application that can be used to build a user interface for the LLM classification evaluator. The app was created manually and includes only basic files.

Run `npm install` and `npm start` inside this folder to launch the development server. The React app should communicate with the FastAPI backend defined in `backend/api.py`.
